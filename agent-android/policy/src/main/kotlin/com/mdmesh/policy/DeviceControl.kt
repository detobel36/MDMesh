/**
 * The narrow, *capability-abstraction* surface the rest of the agent is allowed to
 * touch. Every concrete `DevicePolicyManager` call lives behind one of these
 * operations, never in feature code.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 * Android is a permanent version treadmill: each OS release adds, removes, or
 * restricts a policy API. If feature code called `DevicePolicyManager` directly it
 * would be riddled with `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` branches and would crash on
 * devices where an API is missing. Instead:
 *
 *  1. Feature code asks for a high-level operation (e.g. "set Wi-Fi enabled").
 *  2. A [PolicyStrategy] / factory picks the right implementation for *this* SDK.
 *  3. If no implementation exists, the operation is simply never advertised in the
 *     [com.mdmesh.proto.CapabilityMatrix], so the server never asks for it.
 *
 * Operations return [PolicyOutcome] rather than throwing, so a degraded device
 * reports `unsupported`/`failed` instead of crashing.
